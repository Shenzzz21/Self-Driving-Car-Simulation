# Self-Driving-Car-Simulation

The development of the self-driving car simulation was carried out incrementally, integrating reinforcement learning (Q-learning) with A pathfinding* inside a 2D road environment built using Pygame. The process consisted of setting up the environment, implementing the agent with a Sense–Think–Act–Reflect cycle, embedding the A* pathfinding algorithm, and integrating Q-learning for adaptive decision-making.
